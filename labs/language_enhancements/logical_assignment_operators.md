Logical Assignment Operators (&&=, ||=, ??=) combine logical operators with assignment, simplifying common patterns for conditional assignment.

```js
/*
Use logical assignment operators to simplify the following code
*/
let a = 1;
a = a && 2;

let b = null;
b = b || 3;

let c = undefined;
c = c ?? 4;
```
