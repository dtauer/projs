Binary and octal literals provide a way to represent binary and octal numbers in JavaScript.

```js
/*
Create binary and octal numbers and log them to the console
*/
const binary = 0b1010;
const octal = 0o12;
console.log(binary, octal);
```

```solution
const binary = 0b1010;
const octal = 0o12;
console.log(binary, octal);
```
