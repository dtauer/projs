The `includes()` method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or `false` as appropriate.

```js
/*
Use includes to check if the array contains the value 3
*/
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = arr.includes(3);
console.log(result);
```

```solution
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = arr.includes(3);
console.log(result);
```
