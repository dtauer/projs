The `Function.prototype.toString` method has been updated to provide exact source code, including comments and whitespace. This helps in debugging and understanding the function's content.

```js
/*
Call the toString method on the following function and observe the output
*/
function example() {
  // This is an example function
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}

console.log(example.toString());
```
