The `toSpliced()` method returns a new array with some elements removed or replaced. It does not modify the original array.

```js
/*
Use the toSpliced method to create a new array with some elements removed
*/
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const spliced = arr.toSpliced(1, 2);
console.log(spliced);
```

```solution
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const spliced = arr.toSpliced(1, 2);
console.log(spliced);
```
