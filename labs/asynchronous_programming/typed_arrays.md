Typed Arrays provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data in JavaScript. They offer a way to read and write binary data in buffers.

```js
/*
Use a Uint8Array to read and write binary data
*/
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);
const uint8 = new Uint8Array(buffer);
uint8[0] = 255;
console.log(uint8);
```

```solution
const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(8);
const uint8 = new Uint8Array(buffer);
uint8[0] = 255;
console.log(uint8);
```
